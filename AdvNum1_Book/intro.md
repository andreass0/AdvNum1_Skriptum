# 207.014 Advanced Numerical Methods in Building Science 1 VU

## Introduction

The focus of this course is to give you an introduction into numerical methods and modelling techniques which have
proven themselves to be helpful when modelling reoccurring problems in building science. This script should
accompany your lecture and help you understand the theoretical concepts with interactive code. Feel
free to either download the source files or start up a binder to execute the code directly without an IDE.

The cited secondary literature can be found in the [References-Section](References.md). Many of the explained concepts
are based on {cite}`patankarNumericalHeatTransfer1980`, {cite}`waltherBuildingPhysicsApplications2021` and
{cite}`hagentoftIntroductionBuildingPhysics2001`.

**Autoren:** Univ.-Prof.Dr.techn. DI Thomas Bednar, Univ.Ass. DI Andreas Sarkany BSc.
