  abstract = {A fundamental error relation inherent in the Gauss divergence theorem provided the basis for studying the truncation error of the finite volume method with cell center formulation for a model steady convective equation. The consistency of the classical first- and second-order upwind schemes are proved to be seriously dependent on the grid distribution. If the simple nature of the finite volume method is retained, it is found that a consistent scheme for convective terms can not avoid the dissipation due to grid nonuniformity. The geometrical interpretation of the diffusive terms such as VZO are undertaken. Classical finite volume methods, which average an undefined 0 from its neighbouring nodes, are shown to introduce false fluxes whenever grid nonuniformity is present. A simple modification is proposed to cancel the false fluxes. Two test cases for the Laplace equation illustrate the applicability of the proposed scheme. However, even with this modified scheme, the consistency problem of the diffusion term is found to be seriously dependent on the grid uniformity.},

  abstract = {On one end of the scientific literature, profusion of works about solving partial differential equations exist, however often with a somewhat unfamiliar mathematical formalism. On the other end, volumes dealing with building physics may be either technical about HVAC or rather generic about the equations to be used. Having struggled quite a bit in the past years with the practical implementation of numerical methods in this field, it appeared that putting together the recipes used in a modern programming language could be of interest. Hence the parti pris in this book is to show the link between the governing equations and how to solve them, aiming at a practical use (i.e. ''how to make things work''). It can be seen as a toolbox for simulation engineering, a basis for the illustration of theory or a kick-start for the study of more complex problems. This manual is composed of three chapters, with gradual increase in difficulty: \textbullet{} Chapter 1 succinctly explains the fundamentals of the numerical methods used. \textbullet{} Chapter 2 shows applications of these methods to heat transfer in phase change materials, PID control, indoor air quality and geothermal heat pumps. \textbullet{} Chapter 3 deals with coupled problems and minimisation. Applications to polydispersed aerosols in enclosures, heat and mass transfer in walls and parameter fitting for transient problems are proposed.},
