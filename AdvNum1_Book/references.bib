Particularly in the residential sector, that represents one of the most relevant sector for the energy demand, effective and reliable evaluation tools are required for this aim. Unfortunately, building stocks are characterized by a very large number of buildings that are referred to different construction periods and are equipped with a variety of appliances and tools, other than with different heating and cooling systems. This means that the whole energy consumption of a large territorial context cannot be obtained by simply summing up the energy requirements of each single dwelling and building. A procedure is therefore needed that, by means of a suitable characterization of the building stock and of the structure of the energy consumption, allows to assess the whole residential energy requirements and the effects induced by energy conservation measures.},

  abstract = {The hygrothermal simulation of hygroscopic building materials is a real challenge, in terms of regulations and labelling, but also in decision-making. Today, we lack reference models for the hygrothermal behavior of a whole building. A scoping literature review is conducted to provide an overview of current state-of-the-art methods in order to address of these simulation methods. The most comprehensive studies are selected and examined in detail. These include physical models (White-box), which focus on solving equations that simulate the hygrothermal behavior of buildings, and data driven models, which involve implementing a prediction model using machine learning techniques (Black-box). On one hand, the white-box models are reviewed according to a two-category classification: CFD and Nodal approaches. On the other hand, the principal model used for black-box models is neural network models. The study highlights the need for a recognized method for hygrothermal simulations of hygroscopic envelopes. It provides a better understanding of the hygrothermal simulation, which helps to choose the most suitable tool or model. In addition, this review points out that there is limited application of data-driven methods to simulate the hygrothermal behavior of hygroscopic envelopes. This analysis study highlights future research gaps to overcome in order to stimulate data-driven building performance design.},

  abstract = {Large amounts of waste heat during the cooling process of supermarket refrigeration systems (SRS) would be released. A heat recovery strategy potentially contributes to reducing the supermarket's heating costs related to buying heat from a district heating system (DHS). This paper explores the techno-economic feasibility of heat recovery for a real SRS integrated with a heat recovery unit (HRU) in terms of designing a dynamic heat recovery control (HRC) and business models. A cost-effective HRC is firstly developed for HRU to optimally manipulate the amount of heat recovered, thereby minimizing the real-time heat recovery cost. Furthermore, the business models of heat recovery under a long-term operation are proposed based on two transactional strategies between the SRS and DHS. A field test of the dynamic heat recovery for a remote SRS in Copenhagen Nordhavn area is conducted which demonstrates the proposed HRC algorithm can have a benefit of 0.49e from a 3-h heat recovery operation. Moreover, the one-year operation of the SRS is also simulated which proves the developed two business models of heat recovery can achieve significant savings of 93\% and 41\% in energy costs. \textcopyright{} 2022 The Author(s).

The consistency of the classical first- and second-order upwind schemes are proved to be seriously dependent on the grid distribution. If the simple nature of the finite volume method is retained, it is found that a consistent scheme for convective terms can not avoid the dissipation due to grid nonuniformity. The geometrical interpretation of the diffusive terms such as VZO are undertaken. Classical finite volume methods, which average an undefined 0 from its neighbouring nodes, are shown to introduce false fluxes whenever grid nonuniformity is present. A simple modification is proposed to cancel the false fluxes. Two test cases for the Laplace equation illustrate the applicability of the proposed scheme. However, even with this modified scheme, the consistency problem of the diffusion term is found to be seriously dependent on the grid uniformity.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a building model designed for an urban energy simulation tool. In this context, tradeoff between computing time and result precision is particularly important. Our methodology involves physical simplifications and model order reduction. The physical simplications are achieved by using equivalent envelopes, linearization scheme and pre-processing, so that a Modelica detailed model can be derived into a linear and time-invariant system using fewer component models. Balanced realization reduction can then be applied on such systems leading finally to a 6-order model. Effects of the simplification and reduction on heating and cooling loads are evaluated using typical building envelope cases. Results show that the simplifications and reduction induce errors under 1\% in annual energy consumption and a maximum of 3\% in instantaneous values but are accurate enough to reproduce dynamics of the detailed model. Additionally, the final reduced model uses a simple numerical solver and runs in less than 1 s without compromising precision for hourly annual simulations being 700 times faster than the detailed model, which is promising for use in urban energy simulation.},

Hence, this paper investigates the accuracy of low-order resistance and capacitance (RC) models for applications in energy and demand side management. Simulations are carried out for single-family houses equipped with underfloor heating systems. A detailed reference model is created in EnergyPlus for comparison, while the RC model is based on previous literature and parameterized based on a typology approach. The analysis studies the dynamic behaviour of the indoor temperature and energy demand during a winter period. The results reveal that the modelling approach for the heating system and solar radiation limits the accuracy of the RC model. Therefore, model modification by changing relevant parameters with curve fitting techniques and by extensions of the model structure. As a result, this paper clarifies that the RC models have sufficient accuracy after the modifications.},

Moreover, it is estimated by the National Energy Technology Laboratory that more than one-fourth of the 713 GW of U.S. electricity demand in 2010 could be dispatchable if only buildings could respond to that dispatch through advanced building energy control and operation strategies and smart grid infrastructure. Energy forecasting models for building energy systems are essential to building energy control and operation. Three general categories of building energy forecasting models have been reported in the literature which include white-box (physics-based), black-box (data-driven), and gray-box (combination of physics based and data-driven) modeling approaches. This paper summarizes the existing efforts in this area as well as other critical areas related to building energy modeling, such as short-term weather forecasting. An up-to-date overview of research on application of building energy modeling methods in optimal control for single building and multiple buildings is also summarized in this paper. Different model-based and model-free optimization methods for building energy system operation are reviewed and compared in this paper. Agent based modeling, as a new modeling strategy, has made a remarkable progress in distributed energy systems control and optimization in the past years. The research literature on application of agent based model in building energy system control and operation is also identified and discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {A large number of Building Energy Simulation (BES) tools with a different focus and degree of detail are available however, increasing the model complexity usually increases the modelling time and the number of required inputs, not always leading to better accuracy. Therefore it is important to find the tradeoff between model complexity and computational time having in mind the purpose and goal of the simulation study and the available inputs. To shed some light on these aspects, different modelling approaches (i.e. thermal zone model, window model, thermal mass, etc. . .) are implemented using a cross-validated Simulink model of an office cell and the influence of each analysed aspect on the hourly results is addressed using the Goodness-of-fit and the computational time. As a result, it is observed that modelling the thermal zone with a two-star model leads to a good agreement with the surface-to-surface detailed radiation model in terms of energy balance and operative temperature in the centre of the room, but deviations are present when the temperature in a specific location of the room (e.g. near the window) has to be evaluated. In addition, it is found that a simplified thermal zone model such as one-star model allows important savings in terms of computational time, but leads to deviations in the dynamic behaviour. However, the energy balance can have an acceptable accuracy for specific applications when the inputs are calibrated. Regarding the window model, the results show that it strongly affects the accuracy of the simulation. Furthermore, many aspects that are often overlooked, such as the models of the adiabatic structure, sky model, capacity of the air node, distribution of the radiative gains to the surfaces of the enclosure and convective and radiative exchange coefficients, influence both the accuracy of the results and the computational time.},

  abstract = {Building Energy Simulation (BES) tools play a key role in the optimization of the building system during the different phases, from pre-design through commissioning to operation. BES tools are increasingly used in research as well as in companies. New BES tools and updated versions are continuously being released. Each tool follows an independent validation process but rarely all the tools are compared against each other using a common case study. In this work, the modelling approaches of widespread dynamic simulation tools (i.e. EnergyPlus, TRNSYS, Simulink libraries CarnotUIBK and ALMABuild, IDA ICE, Modelica/Dymola and DALEC), as well as PHPP (a well-known quasi-steady-state tool), are described and the results of all the tools modelling the same characteristic office cell, defined within the IEA SHC Task 56, are compared on a monthly and hourly basis for the climates of Stockholm, Stuttgart and Rome. Unfortunately, different tools require different levels of input detail, which are often not matching with available data, hence the parametrization process highly influences the quality of the simulation results. In the current study to evaluate the deviation between the tools, frequently used statistical indices and normalization methods are analysed and the problems related to their application, in a cross-comparison of different tools, are investigated. In this regard, the deviation thresholds indicated by ASHRAE Guideline 14-2014 are used as a basis to identify results that suggest an acceptable level of disagreement between the predictions of a particular model and the outcomes of all models. The process of reaching a good agreement between all tools required several iterations and great effort on behalf of the modellers. To aid the definition of building component descriptions and future references for intermodel comparison a short history of the executed steps is presented in this work. Together with the comparison of the results of the tools, their computational cost is evaluated and an overview of the modelling approaches supported by the different tools for this case study is provided aiming to support the users in choosing a fit-for-purpose simulation tool.},

For such areas and types of buildings, occupants can operate passive solutions to achieve comfort while energy-consuming ones can offer alternatives during the hottest months. Yet, compared to other climatic zones, specific knowledge on occupant comfort and behaviour is limited, making the work of engineers difficult during the design phase. In this work, occupants' operations on hygrothermal comfort controls, such as windows and fans, were first measured and analysed. Secondly, these behaviours were modelled using two deterministic methods based on machine learning techniques and a probabilistic graphical model. A model was also implemented to estimate the number of people, using the power demand of the electrical outlets. The estimation ability of the behavioural models was evaluated and led to F1 scores greater than 0.7. A two-classifier model was proposed to estimate the level of ceiling fan use. This combined model slightly improves the F1 scores by more that 2\%, which demonstrates the necessity of taking into account the links between the different controls.},

The model is based on the Kron's method developed with the Tensorial Analysis of Networks (TAN). The feasibility of the model is studied with a multi-layer pieces of wall. The TAN thermal modelling methodology is described with different steps of routine algorithm. The Kron's graph equivalent model is elaborated from the Cauer thermal model applied to multi-layer structure. Then, the TAN equation traducing analytically the thermal problem is established. As results, the thermal flux through two- and five-layer of wall was determined. The effectiveness of the building wall TAN model was verified with numerical parameters from a residential building located in the north of the France, subject to a retrofit problem.

  abstract = {On one end of the scientific literature, profusion of works about solving partial differential equations exist, however often with a somewhat unfamiliar mathematical formalism. On the other end, volumes dealing with building physics may be either technical about HVAC or rather generic about the equations to be used. Having struggled quite a bit in the past years with the practical implementation of numerical methods in this field, it appeared that putting together the recipes used in a modern programming language could be of interest. Hence the parti pris in this book is to show the link between the governing equations and how to solve them, aiming at a practical use (i.e. ''how to make things work''). It can be seen as a toolbox for simulation engineering, a basis for the illustration of theory or a kick-start for the study of more complex problems. This manual is composed of three chapters, with gradual increase in difficulty: \textbullet{} Chapter 1 succinctly explains the fundamentals of the numerical methods used. \textbullet{} Chapter 2 shows applications of these methods to heat transfer in phase change materials, PID control, indoor air quality and geothermal heat pumps. \textbullet{} Chapter 3 deals with coupled problems and minimisation. Applications to polydispersed aerosols in enclosures, heat and mass transfer in walls and parameter fitting for transient problems are proposed.},

  abstract = {Sector coupling is expected to play a key role in the decarbonization of the energy system by enabling the integration of decentralized renewable energy sources and unlocking hitherto unused synergies between generation, storage and consumption. Within this context, a transition towards hybrid energy networks (HENs), which couple power, heating/cooling and gas grids, is a necessary requirement to implement sector coupling on a large scale. However, this transition poses practical challenges, because the traditional domain-specific approaches struggle to cover all aspects of HENs. Methods and tools for conceptualization, system planning and design as well as system operation support exist for all involved domains, but their adaption or extension beyond the domain they were originally intended for is still a matter of research and development. Therefore, this work presents innovative tools for modeling and simulating HENs. A categorization of these tools is performed based on a clustering of their most relevant features. It is shown that this categorization has a strong correlation with the results of an independently carried out expert review of potential application areas. This good agreement is a strong indicator that the proposed classification categories can successfully capture and characterize the most important features of tools for HENs. Furthermore, it allows to provide a guideline for early adopters to understand which tools and methods best fit the requirements of their specific applications.},
