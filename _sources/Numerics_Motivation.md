# Introduction to numerical methods-An engineers point of view

## A word about the nature of numerical methods

{cite}`patankarNumericalHeatTransfer1980` gives a helpful note about the numerical investigation of these differential
equations which will be the leading credo for all our numerical investigations in this course:

> "A numerical solution of a differential equation consists of a set of numbers from which the distribution of the
> dependant variable $\Phi$ can be constructed. In this sense, a numerical method is akin to a laboratory experiment, in
> which a set of instrument readings enables us to establish the distribution of the measured quantity in the domain under
> investigation. The numerical analyst and the laboratory experiment both must remain content with only a finite number of
> numerical values as the outcome, although this number can, at least in principle, be made large enough for practical
> purposes." {cite}`patankarNumericalHeatTransfer1980`
