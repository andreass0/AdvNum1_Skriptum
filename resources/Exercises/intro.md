# 207.014 Advanced Numerical Methods in Building Science 1 VU - Exercises

## Introduction

In this book the exercises the students are solving in this course are summarized and explained. This script should
accompany your lecture and help you understand the theoretical concepts with interactive code. Feel
free to either download the source files or start up a binder to execute the code directly without an IDE.

The cited secondary literature can be found in the [References-Section](References.md). Many of the explained concepts
are based on {cite}`patankarNumericalHeatTransfer1980`, {cite}`waltherBuildingPhysicsApplications2021` and
{cite}`hagentoftIntroductionBuildingPhysics2001`.

**Autoren:** Univ.-Prof.Dr.techn. DI Thomas Bednar, Univ.Ass. DI Andreas Sarkany BSc.
